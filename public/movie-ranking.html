 <h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
 <p>The lives of two mob hitmen, a boxer, a gangster's wife, and a pair of diner bandits intertwine in four tales of violence and redemption. The film's non-linear narrative and stylized dialogue have made it a cornerstone of independent cinema. Characters navigate a criminal underworld shaped by chance encounters and fateful decisions, all culminating in a cycle of dark humor and unexpected consequences.</p>

 <h3>Catch Me If You Can</h3>
 <p>This biographical crime film tells the story of Frank Abagnale, a teenage master forger who successfully impersonated a doctor, a lawyer, and a pilot. For years, he is relentlessly pursued across the country by dedicated FBI agent Carl Hanratty. The film details their long chase and the cat-and-mouse game between a brilliant con man and the lawman who becomes obsessed with him.</p>

 <h3>The Godfather</h3>
 <p>The aging patriarch of the Corleone crime family transfers control of his clandestine empire to his reluctant son, Michael. This process forces Michael deeper into the criminal world he had always tried to avoid. As he takes charge, he orchestrates a series of betrayals and brutal attacks to solidify his family's position.</p>
